# Welcome to TMS Days 2023!

This web page contains additional information and detailed explanations for several sessions. In addition to the source code, slides, and illustrations, some sessions contain detailed explanation of the source code shown during the live sessions.

This will allow you to study the code in depth after the event.

## Where's the source code?

All source code is available in a private GitHub repository. I do want to restrict access to attendees of this event. Your have two options:

- Provide your GitHub username and I will add you to the repository.
- Email me and I will provide a ZIP file

{: .note}
I do not consider it necessary to emphasize that there is a clear downside to using the ZIP archive. I have given up on reasoning about the benefits of version control whichever system is being used. If you use the ZIP file, you will not benefit from any future updates that I will make to the source code.

The GitHub repositry is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/holgerflick/yardsales). This link is only accessible if I added your user profile to the repository.
