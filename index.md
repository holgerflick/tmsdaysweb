# Welcome to TMS Days 2023!

This guidebook contains additional information and detailed explanations for several sessions. In addition to the source code, slides, and illustrations, some sessions contain detailed explanation of the source code shown during the live sessions.

My main goal is that this additional content will allow you to study the code in depth after the event. Listening to a session is one thing, but then to reproduce and recall all the information provided in such a short time span is a different story.

All sessions follow an overarching example. The idea is instead of showing several "Hello World" applications, to rather show one application that makes use of the specific tools being presented. This way, it will be much easier to you to incorporate them into your own development cycle.

## Where to start?

Obviously, attend the sessions first. This guidebook will already come in handy while watching the sessions. All slides are available in this book. Thus, you can look at them right in front of you and even when the presentation is no longer showing a certain slide, you can look up the information at any time. 

The same is true for the source code. You can easily navigate into the source while watching the presentation. GitHub will even provide proper formatting for the code.

After attending the session, this book is structured in four main areas. One area will describe the scenario or use case of all the sessions. The other areas cover one session each.

- **Description of the scenario** with in-depth explanation of the use cases that are modelled as well as the database structure. Building a proper database model is also an important aspect of software development, but it is not the primary focus. Still, this book contains an ER diagram and tables with all the tables to allow you to grasp the structure of the model even easier.
- **Key facts** about all the three sessions. The presentations are full of content and this guidebook will pick the most important aspects and shed some more light onto them. This means that even re-usable code snippets can be found in this book.

## Where's the source code?

All source code is available in a private GitHub repository. I do want to restrict access to attendees of this event. Your have two options:

- Provide your GitHub username and I will add you to the repository. With access to the repository, you can use any Git client *or* download a ZIP file reflecting all changes up to that day.
- Email me and I will provide a ZIP file

{: .note}
I do not consider it necessary to emphasize that there is a clear downside to using the ZIP archive. I have given up on reasoning about the benefits of version control whichever system is being used. Here's just one tidbit: If you use the ZIP file, you will not benefit from any future updates that I will make to the source code.

The GitHub repository is available [here](https://github.com/holgerflick/yardsales). This link is only accessible if I added your user profile to the repository. if you do not want to use a Git client to access the latest version, a ZIP file that is completely loosely coupled from version control or any further updates, can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/holgerflick/yardsales/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Still, signing up to the repository allows you to opt-in for notification of future updates.

## Can you offer discounts...

- on one of your books? No. The publisher does not allow me to hand out individual discounts.
- on class-room size orders (10 or more) of your books? Yes. Please get in touch.
- on one of your video courses? Certainly. As an attendee of this event, you are eligible for a 30% discount **during** this event and **in person**. Please ask me for a discount code. 

## I don't like...
- Amazon. **Can I order your book somewhere else?** No. Amazon is my exclusive publisher.
- Teachable. **Can I download your course or purchase it somewhere else?** No. Landgraf.dev is my exclusive learning platform.

## More from Holger

If you liked my sessions, maybe there is even more content available that will help you. On the top of the page, you will find links to my Delphi books and video courses that are available for purchase worldwide. If you just want to say "*Thank you*", you can always buy me [a cup of ☕️](https://ko-fi.com/holgerflick) (thanks to Ko-fi.com).  

## Contracting

I am available for training and contracting to support your software development process. Services can be provided in **German** and **English**.
