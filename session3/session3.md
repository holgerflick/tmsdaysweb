# TMS XData & TMS WEB Core

Interested parties need to be able to sign up for a yard sale in order to become participants. The web application needs to present a sign-up form that is specific for a certain yard sale. You will learn to build a responsive form with Bootstrap that is fed with information from an XData web service. As time allows, we will gallivant around the backend and the front end to get the most number of examples how this all fits together.

{: .note}
This session expects basic knowledge of TMS WEB Core and TMS XData as we cannot start from scratch if we want to inspect a practical example. The focus of this session is **responsive web design using TMS WEB Core**. How the application retrieves its data is explained, but the server-side cannot be explained in full detail in 45 minutes. 

- If you want to learn **XData from scratch** and how to hook it up any database, please consider purchasing my [XData online course](https://courses.landgraf.dev/p/xdata22),.
- [Hands-on Book 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BGPGH3Q) is also very much recommended and focusing on this subject.
- My book [TMS WEB Core, 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2RX8NXK) gives detailed information how to start building **web applications** like this one step-by-step.

In the first part of the session, we will focus on the design of the web page. Key is to be able to bind your HTML layout to TMS WEB Core. Then, we will retrieve information from the web services. Finally, if time allows, we will have a look how the web service prepares the data for our application.
