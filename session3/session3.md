# TMS XData & TMS WEB Core

Interested parties need to be able to sign up for a yard sale in order to become participants. The web application needs to present a sign-up form that is specific for a certain yard sale. You will learn to build a responsive form with Bootstrap that is fed with information from an XData web service. As time allows, we will gallivant around the backend and the front end to get the most number of examples how this all fits together.

{: .note}
The focus of this session is **responsive web design using TMS WEB Core**. How the application retrieves its data is explained, but the server-side cannot be explained in full detail in 45 minutes. 

- Please consider purchasing my [XData online course](https://courses.landgraf.dev/p/xdata22), if you want to learn XData from scratch and how to hook up any database.
- [Hands-on Book 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BGPGH3Q) is also very much focused on this subject.
